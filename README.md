# Code Showcase 4

This repo is for displaying the things I have learned to code and concepts grasped for coding in Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and using responses, requests, promises, NPM packages, and deployment to a Deta micro. Each file will contain comments that explain the code I used and my thinking behind it.

### WeatherProject

This app is designed to deploy locally and use OpenWeather APIs to get the current forecast. *Uses JS, Node, Express, NPM, Resp, Req, Promises, Parsers, and API endpoints.* Keys have been removed.

**Desired output:** A locally hosted app that will allow you to search for the current weather report in breif through city name or zip.

### Newsletter-Signup

This app was deployed to a Deta micro VM server and can be found here <https://hnejkp.deta.dev/>. *Uses Express, Node NPM, Resp, Req, Promises, Parsers, and API endpoints.*

**Desired output:** A virtually hosted server that delivers the Express app which allows someone to signup to my newsletter list.

#### Markdown, Git CLI, and Github

This document also displays a basic understanding of Markdown. Additionally the repo was create on Github, but the versioning and remote push were all executed from the CMD line with Git.
